MSDS6372 Project 1 Summer 2021 
Team: Joseph Lazarus, Rick Fontenot,  Satvik Ajmera

In this project we explore a kaggle data set compiled from the WHO with the goal of building models to study key relationships to global life expectancy.

Our commented code is broken up into separate rmd files for each section of the project:
1) EDA.Rmd : Exploratory data analysis including outputting clean, transformed and scaled data sets which feed into the following modeling files
2) Objective1_mlr.Rmd : an initial multiple regression modeling process based on intuitive variable selection and preparation through EDA insights
3) Objective2_complex_mlr.Rmd : added complexity to the initial mlr by using LASSO to select intereaction terms
4) Objective2_nonparametric.Rmd : study non-parametric modeling such ass knn-regression to evaluate vs. linear models

A written summary of our project is included in the MSDS6372_Project1.pdf file
