From https://www.kaggle.com/philbowman212/life-expectancy-exploratory-data-analysis

Variable Descriptions
Format: variable (type) - description

country (Nominal) - the country in which the indicators are from (i.e. United States of America or Congo)

year (Ordinal) - the calendar year the indicators are from (ranging from 2000 to 2015)

status (Nominal) - whether a country is considered to be 'Developing' or 'Developed' by WHO standards

life_expectancy (Ratio) - the life expectancy of people in years for a particular country and year

adult_mortality (Ratio) - the adult mortality rate per 1000 population (i.e. number of people dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population); if the rate is 263 then that means 263 people will die out of 1000 between the ages of 15 and 60; another way to think of this is that the chance an individual will die between 15 and 60 is 26.3%

infant_deaths (Ratio) - number of infant deaths per 1000 population; similar to above, but for infants

alcohol (Ratio) - a country's alcohol consumption rate measured as liters of pure alcohol consumption per capita

percentage_expenditure (Ratio) - expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (gdp)

hepatitis_b (Ratio) - number of 1 year olds with Hepatitis B immunization over all 1 year olds in population

measles (Ratio) - number of reported Measles cases per 1000 population

bmi (Interval/Ordinal) - average Body Mass Index (BMI) of a country's total population

under-five_deaths (Ratio) - number of people under the age of five deaths per 1000 population

polio (Ratio) - number of 1 year olds with Polio immunization over the number of all 1 year olds in population

total_expenditure (Ratio) - government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure

diphtheria (Ratio) - Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunization rate of 1 year olds

hiv/aids (Ratio) - deaths per 1000 live births caused by HIV/AIDS for people under 5; number of people under 5 who die due to 

HIV/AIDS per 1000 births

gdp (Ratio) - Gross Domestic Product per capita

population (Ratio) - population of a country

thinness_1-19_years (Ratio) - rate of thinness among people aged 10-19 (Note: variable should be renamed to thinness_10-19_years 
to more accurately represent the variable)

thinness_5-9_years (Ratio) - rate of thinness among people aged 5-9

income_composition_of_resources (Ratio) - Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources (index ranging from 0 to 1)

schooling (Ratio) - average number of years of schooling of a population

Since Population data issue caused per capita calculation issue on GDP, does it affect any otherper capita variables like:

alcohol (Ratio) - a country's alcohol consumption rate measured as liters of pure alcohol consumption per capita

percentage_expenditure (Ratio) - expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (gdp)

measles (Ratio) - number of reported Measles cases per 1000 population

under-five_deaths (Ratio) - number of people under the age of five deaths per 1000 population

total_expenditure (Ratio) - government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure

Explore Correlations and relationships between variables

```{r corr-EDA}
#Create function to summarize the most significant correlations since there are too many variables for one plot
corr_simple <- function(data=df,sig=0.1){
  #convert data to numeric in order to run correlations
  #convert to factor first to keep the integrity of the data - each value will become a number rather than turn into NA
  df_cor <- data %>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
  df_cor <- df_cor %>% mutate_if(is.factor, as.numeric)
  #run a correlation and drop the insignificant ones
  corr <- cor(df_cor)
  #prepare to drop duplicates and correlations of 1     
  corr[lower.tri(corr,diag=TRUE)] <- NA 
  #drop perfect correlations

  #sort by highest correlation
  corr <- corr[order(-abs(corr$Freq)),] 
  #print table

numerical<-kaggle.training %>% select(-Country,-Status)
# ggpairs(numerical) to many combinations for plot to be useful

numerical %>%
  gather(-Life.expectancy, key = "var", value = "value") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = Life.expectancy, )) +
    geom_point(size=0.01) +
    facet_wrap(~ var, scales = "free") 

#Initial observations to explore:
#Adult.Mortality has high correlation appears to be two groups explore what separates groups
#Alcohol looks weak overall but may have clusters dependent on other factors
#BMI is similar
#Diptheria is similar
#GDP may need a transformation

#All should be explored with plotly to look at groupings
 #Why do so many variables have two distinct groupings in correlations? Is there a Country or data issue?

kaggle.training %>% ggplot(aes(x = Adult.Mortality, y = Life.expectancy)) +
    geom_point(size=0.5)

#Create manual grouping based on (0,90) to (150,40) which translates to Life = -0.33Mortality + 90
kaggle.training["Life.line"]=-0.33*kaggle.training$Adult.Mortality + 90

kaggle.training["grouping1"] <- ifelse(kaggle.training$Life.line >=kaggle.training$Life.expectancy, "A", "B")
kaggle.training$grouping1<-as.factor(kaggle.training$grouping1)

#verify manual grouping worked on scatterplot
kaggle.training %>% ggplot(aes(x = Adult.Mortality, y = Life.expectancy,color=grouping1)) +
    geom_point(size=0.5)

#Check to see if same grouping explains clustering on other scatter plots
numerical2<-kaggle.training %>% select(-Country,-Status) %>% gather(-Life.expectancy,-grouping1, key = "var", value = "value")

```

For Manual grouping1 see what could explain difference between clusters

```{r}
stat.test <- numerical2 %>%
  group_by(var) %>%
  t_test(value ~ grouping1) %>%
  adjust_pvalue(method = "BH") %>%
  add_significance()

#Sort and display numerical variables with highest significant difference by Attrition
stat.test <- stat.test %>% select(p, everything())
stat.test <- stat.test[order(stat.test$p),] 
stat.test

#Year is strongest correlation on grouping
kaggle.training %>% ggplot(aes(x=grouping1, y=Year)) + geom_boxplot()
kaggle.training %>% ggplot(aes(x=grouping1, y=GDP)) + geom_boxplot()
kaggle.training %>% ggplot(aes(x=grouping1, y=Measles)) + geom_boxplot()

kaggle.training %>% ggplot(aes(x = Adult.Mortality, y = Life.expectancy,color=Year)) +
    geom_point(size=0.5)

#No simple explanation for clustering

```

Try knn model on Life Expectancy vs. Mortality EXPLORE THIS MORE LATER

```{r}
knn.input<-na.omit(kaggle.training)

classifications = knn.cv(knn.input[,c(2,6:22)],knn.input$grouping1,prob = TRUE, k = 3)
confusionMatrix(table(classifications,knn.input$grouping1))

```

Plot variables vs population to see if some need to be normalized to per capita

```{r}
kaggle.training %>% ggplot(aes(x = Population, y = Adult.Mortality)) + geom_point(size=0.5)
kaggle.training %>% ggplot(aes(x = Population, y = infant.deaths)) + geom_point(size=0.5)
kaggle.training %>% ggplot(aes(x = Population, y = GDP)) + geom_point(size=0.5)
